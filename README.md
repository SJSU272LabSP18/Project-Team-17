# Project Idea 1:

--> A solution to predict precise locations of ambulances along with analyzing the real time traffic over the past few years. 
    By clustering technique (K-Means) we present an optimal solution for positioning of ambulances through the city.
    We can quantitavely measure the enhancement to verify the results.
    The goal is to use machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and reduce the response time in case of emergencies.
 <br>Technologies to be used during the work flow are :
<br>Python  - For programming
<br>Google API  - To anaylse the data set
<br>Tableau - For data visualization and representation

# Project Idea 2: 

--> Automated Parking System using Internet of Things (IoT) which enables the user to find the closest parking area and gives
    precise information about vacant parking spaces. And primarily it focused on reducing the time in locating the
    open parking lots and hence minimizing the redundant exploring of filled parking lots.

# Project Idea 3: 
 
--> Build a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) based Biometric system for authentication using Raspberry Pi and cloud
    computing with use of Cryptographic algorithms RSA and AES-256 to maintain the security of biometric traits over the Internet
    channel to the cloud.
