#Project Ideas:

--> A solution to predict precise ambulance locations in a city analyzing the real time data traffic over the past few years. 
    By clustering technique(K-Means) we present an optimal solution for positioning of ambulances through the city.
    We can quantitavely measure the improvement to verify the results.
    The goal is to use machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and response time in case of emergencies.
    Technologies to be used during the work flow are :
  --Python  - For programming
  --Google API  - To anaylse the data set
  --Tableau - For data visualization and representation
