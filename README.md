#Project Idea 1:

--> A solution to predict precise ambulance locations in a city analyzing the real time data traffic over the past few years. 
    By clustering technique(K-Means) we present an optimal solution for positioning of ambulances through the city.
    We can quantitavely measure the improvement to verify the results.
    The goal is to use machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and response time in case of emergencies.
 <br>Technologies to be used during the work flow are :
<br>Python  - For programming
<br>Google API  - To anaylse the data set
<br>Tableau - For data visualization and representation

#Project Idea 2: 

--> Automated Parking System using Internet of Things (IoT) which enables the user to find the nearest parking area and gives
    availability of parking slots in that respective parking area. And it mainly focus on reducing the time in finding the
    parking lots and also it avoids the unnecessary travelling through filled parking lots in a parking area.

#Project Idea 3: 
 
--> Building a low cost Internet of Things (IoT) based Biometric system for authentication using Raspberry Pi and cloud
    computing. Cryptographic algorithms RSA and AES-256 is used to maintain the security of biometric traits over the Internet
    channel to the cloud.
